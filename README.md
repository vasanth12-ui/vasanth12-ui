## üöÄ Projects

Here are some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on:

### [Quality_Sentinels](https://github.com/vasanth12-ui/Quality_Sentinels)
In this project, I automated the end-to-end testing of the
"Add Points" functionality on a user account page. The
goal was to ensure the functionality works as expected
in various scenarios, including successful point
addition, handling invalid input, and verifying UI
updates.
Login Automation: Successfully automated login process,
ensuring correct redirection to the user dashboard.
Error Handling: Automated test cases ensured that invalid input
(negative points) was handled with appropriate error messages.
UI Consistency: Ensured that the points balance was visually
updated after each addition.
